Begin by installing MFEM

We will need the CUDA build of MFEM. The parallel version with hypre and METIS may be useful.

In the compile script, point the command towards the mfem-x.x build directory. Additionally, it may be useful to create a link to the glvis executable from the DeNT directory.

After the code is compiled, it can be run (preferably on a compute node).

./glvis -m 1_10x1_10.mesh -g output/1/sf.gf
The above command can be used to visualize the results at a single time step. The mesh file may change for other test problems.
